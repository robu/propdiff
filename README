Usage

Build with ant.

Run with:

java -jar propdiff.jar file1.properties file1_fi.properties file1_sv.properties > result.csv

For easy viewing, open the output file in OpenOffice/Excel. 'X' in a column means that the key exists in
that particular properties file. Empty means it's missing. Keys that exist in all files are hidden from output.
